   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   TO CHANGE A SCRIPT   Edit the text between the backticks in  content: `...`
   TO ADD A CARD        Copy one { content: `...` } block inside an entry's cards: [ ].
   TO ADD AN ENTRY      Copy a whole { id: ..., cards: [...] } block, paste it under the
                        matching tab heading, then change title / cards.
   TO ADD A NEW TAB     Use a new id: value. It appears automatically (under "More" until
                        you list it in assets/js/config.js -> tabs.groups).
   Fields   id         tab name (must match exactly, e.g. 'Opening', 'CEP-Probing')
            category   'chat' or 'voice'
            title      heading shown on the left of the cards
            description  optional grey sub-text under the title
            created / updated   dates in YYYY-MM-DD form. Set created (or bump updated)
                        to TODAY on a new/changed card to show the New / Updated badge.
   Placeholders  [Cx Name] [Agent Name] [Brand] [Website Address] ... become click-to-fill fields.
   Formatting    <br> = new line.  Do not use a backtick or ${ inside text (write \` instead).
                 A non-breaking space is written \u00a0 so it stays visible; leave it as is.
   Safety net    GitHub runs  node tools/check-data.mjs  on every change and flags typos
                 (missing comma, bad category...) before they reach the site.

Remember that neither [Brand] nor any airline will ask for additional financial information through email. Contact us to verify any suspicious communication. 3. Be wary of payment requests that are unexpected. Genuine requests will come through a secure payment link or phone after security clearance. 4. Do not enter financial information on non-secure websites, and do not share passwords or security codes over the phone.  We advise customers to monitor any suspicious activity and report any concerns to our support team. Additional support measures will be communicated as needed.

The financial plan has been approved, and the airline is now actively processing refund requests. However, they have only refunded bookings partially, without covering for the entire cost of the ticket(s).  Based on the information provided by the airline, this is the final and total refund that we should expect for your booking. Therefore we have closed your refund case after completing the payout. We have refunded you the full amount received from the airline without charging any fees from our side.  We understand that this may be less than ideal, but as an intermediary, we can only refund what we receive from the airline and are not liable for any service that was not provided by the carrier. If you have any questions about the refunded amount, we kindly ask you to address them directly to the airline, as we do not have any further information about this matter. Thank you for your understanding.`,

        content: `The refund you received is connected to your booking with Czech Airlines. Recently, the carrier underwent a reorganization process in the Municipal Law Court of Prague to avoid bankruptcy. The financial plan has been approved, and the airline is now actively processing refund requests. However, they have only refunded bookings partially, without covering the entire cost of the ticket(s).   Based on the information provided by the airline, this is the final and total refund that we should expect for your booking. Therefore we have closed your refund case after completing the payout.  We have refunded you the full amount received from the airline without charging any fees from our side.   We understand that this may be less than ideal, but as an intermediary, we can only refund what we receive from the airline and are not liable for any service that was not provided by the carrier. If you have any questions about the refunded amount, we kindly ask you to address them directly to the airline, as we do not have any further information about this matter.  Thank you for your understanding.`,
